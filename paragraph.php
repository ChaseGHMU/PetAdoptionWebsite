<p>Welcome to Paw-lease Adopt Me! This page was made by Chase Allen for CS3380's Final Project. The websites core functionality is for "adopting" dogs. This paragraph was loaded using an AJAX function call. If you create an account, an option is put in the navbar above to adopt a dog. After adopting, you can go to your account info page and look at the dogs you've adopted. You also have the opportunity to remove the dog from your page. The information page contains info about all the dogs and videos telling you about their breed. If you have any questions about the website, you can email me at cjan8c@mail.missouri.edu</p>
